**Incident Description**	 | House renovation **&** White wash{Last November we decided to decorate our home, as since long we did not do white wash and all that work. So we decided to handover that work to a contractor. The estimate time of completion was about one week which covers the whole wooden and walls decorations. First day was full of energetic, he prepaired one room in a single day.Then the next day beguns and he started doing time pass and continiously using phones in working time. Time starts passing then same thing happended next day and the days starts passing. All household items were lying on the floor here & there. My birthday came in between that work, I will never forgot my last birthday because I was tired and full with dust. That work was completed after once week of the estimateds time. He wasted maximum materials on floors and lots of droplets lying here and there.}
