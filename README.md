## ***"My Passion"***
* My passion is to hangout with my partner. I always try to go outdoor with my partner so that we can spent some quality time with each other. Normally we used to go malls,parks, museums and other public places for hangout but my wish is to take her some other place i.e: outside the town or if possible then we would like to go out of the country.As of now my earnings are not pretty much high for this, thats why I'm trying to focus on my career. So that I can make our dreams complete in the next up-coming years. For convencing both families we have to be successful and stand on our feets.
